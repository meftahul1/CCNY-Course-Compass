overview of the field of anthropology. As it is a four sub-field discipline providing a holistic understanding of human life, the class will delve into each sub-field. Students are expected to leave with a fuller appreciation of Anthropology and with knowledge of linguistic anthropology, biological anthropology, archaeology, and socio-cultural anthropology. Through such an approach, students will have a deeper and more expansive understanding of human history and contemporary matters. One of the goals of this class is to better our grasp of anthropology and thus give us a socio-scientific toolkit to interpret our social worlds and thus prepare students for advanced classes in the major and in other social science fields.","1":"This class provides a general overview of the field of anthropology.

Critical examinations of global heritage and colonialism sheds lighton the politics of archaeology and the significance of the past in the present. 3 hr.\/wk.; 3 cr.","5":"In the 20th and 21st centuries, the safety and survival of Black women have become central to rethinking public safety. The #SayHerName campaign exemplifies this shift, offering a platform for voices often marginalized by mainstream media. This course examines how Black women in the US, impacted by the intersection of patriarchal misogyny and anti-Black racism, face both hypervisibility and invisibility. Their experiences with public safety are often ignored, complicating discussions about state-sanctioned violence and their protection. We will explore how narratives around gender and race shape public safety perceptions and policies. Through videos, readings, podcasts, guest speakers, and discussions, this course investigates the role of narrative power and rhetoric in shaping the experiences and advocacy for the safety and freedom of Black women and girls. We'll analyze how these narratives impact their rights and the broader fight for their well-being and self-determination.","6":"This course explores how gender and secuality are iterated, performed, challenged, and managed. Instead of seeing gender and secuality as coherent and easily quantifiable categories, this class delves into the nany contradictions in the categories of gender and secuality in order to unpack everyday taken for granted assumptions. Furthermore, students will examine how these categories intersect, how they inform each other, and how they gain raction with race, class, and ethinicity.","7":"This course explores the relationship between illness, suffering and healing across a range of medical systems, including biomedicine. Cultural practices and belief systems are analyzed with specific attention to the ways in which political and economic power shape illness and suffering around the world. Students are introduced to key concepts in medical anthropology and address challenging material on health, illness and the body cross-\u00ad-culturally.","8":"This course introduces the interdisciplinary field of childhood studies through an anthropological lens.

The #SayHerName campaign exemplifies this shift, offering a platform for voices often marginalized by mainstream media. This course examines how Black women in the US, impacted by the intersection of patriarchal misogyny and anti-Black racism, face both hypervisibility and invisibility. Their experiences with public safety are often ignored, complicating discussions about state-sanctioned violence and their protection. We will explore how narratives around gender and race shape public safety perceptions and policies. Through videos, readings, podcasts, guest speakers, and discussions, this course investigates the role of narrative power and rhetoric in shaping the experiences and advocacy for the safety and freedom of Black women and girls. We'll analyze how these narratives impact their rights and the broader fight for their well-being and self-determination.","25":"This course explores how gender and secuality are iterated, performed, challenged, and managed.

Using the lens of ?housing justice? and ?a right to housing,? the course explores and critiques contemporary discourse on ?affordable housing? as a strategy for dealing with the global housing crisis. By looking at the core assumptions and approaches that various disciplines have applied to the complex conundrum of housing, the course will provoke students to ask questions and formulate a personal position about the role of research, government, finance, and design in addressing the global housing crisis.","97":"Introduction to Urban Studies will expose students to the interdisciplinary study of cities and urban development.

Final projects will be a written and illustrated profile of a city of your choosing that analyzes urban development in light of the course?s weekly themes.","98":"This course offers an introduction to the history of cities through time and across cultures?from the emergence of proto-urban settlements in Anatolia some 9,000 years ago to the rise of contemporary megacities such as Lagos or Shenzhen. Throughout the semester, we will consider urban forms in their economic, social, political, and cultural contexts, exploring, among other themes, the notions of citizenship and urbanity, the relationship between urban form and urban life, the process of urbanization, and the search for the ideal city. Although the course follows a roughly chronological trajectory, we will not attempt to trace an impossibly comprehensive survey of urban history across the globe. Rather, by focusing on paradigmatic examples (Uruk, Athens, Rome, Chang?an, Cairo, Lu\u00bfbeck, Florence, Algiers, Chicago, and others) we will examine critical passages of world urban history in order to shed light on the fundamental relation between the city as physical form and the city as political form.","99":"Energy, Infrastructure, and the Worlds of Modern Literature: Covering the 19th century to the present, this course will look at how literature deals with the non-human world: specifically, the sources of energy that power human civilization, our environment, and the forms of infrastructure like housing, food, sanitation, communication, and transit that sustain our daily lives. We often ask what literature can tell us about human beings, our histories and identities, our relationships to one another, and the social forces like race and gender that shape us and that are expressed in literary texts. Without leaving these issues behind, this class will try to approach literature and literary history from a different angle. How do literary texts make infrastructure?which we usually ignore until it breaks down?visible, and to show how it makes human life sustainable? How can literature help us rethink the relationships between the natural world and the built world, especially in the city? How do we tell stories about systems and processes that exceed any one person?s lifetime or understanding? Authors may include Pauline Hopkins, Franz Kafka, EM Forster, Jamaica Kincaid, Arundhati Roy, Namwali Serpell, and others. Short writing assignments, a midterm paper and a final research project.","100":"The course will examine various architectural legacies, languages, and modes of practice across the Latin American region. The sense of unity usually attempted by the term Latin America will be challenged by plural insights into local modes of practice, the assimilation (and refusal) of modern and contemporary international discourses, and emerging contemporary strategies. Through a series of case studies, students will be introduced to design challenges that bridge architectural and urban scales, including informality, infrastructure, and socio-environmental ecologies. Adopting a critical historical lens, we will also investigate indigenous identities and their resonance across time in specific spatial paradigms. The aim of the course is to not only familiarize students with the development of Latin American architectural discourses across time, but also enable them to expand their own design repertoire through alternative strategies that are increasingly suitable to the emerging socio-spatial challenges of North America. Coursework will speculate on the link between thoughtful argumentation and drawing through the integration of critical visualizations and writing.","101":"This seminar takes a workshop format to encourage students to develop fluency in multimedia communication about the built environment. Design ? at all scales ? is inherently an act of storytelling. When addressing the urban scale, before designers can intervene in urban space, they must learn the tools to observe and interpret urban dynamics and to create documentary evocations of existing conditions. This course focuses on developing qualitative tools of place-based analysis and representation, informed by a deep dive into the history of mutual influence between documentary media and urban discourse over the past century. Through reading, viewing, and discussion, this seminar will expose students to the history and the vanguard of storytelling techniques and philosophies. This legacy is of growing importance as the worlds of media production and design increasingly converge. From new job opportunities for design professionals to new expectations for business development, community engagement, and strategic communication, today?s designers must be critical storytellers ? especially as our selective reliance on data risks undermining designers? crucial roles as interpreters of the places where we live and work. The seminar?s curriculum is rooted in the belief that identifying, uncovering, and producing well-researched narratives about place is an integral part of the design process.","102":"Historic preservation is traditionally concerned with protecting architectural structures with ?significant? character. This definition leaves out the myriad and more ephemeral ways that heritage and memory manifest in neighborhoods like Harlem. It also often overlooks aesthetics, subjectivities, histories, and spaces that fall outside of the more traditional and Eurocentric ?canon? of our discipline(s). This class will operate in relationship to those efforts, as a one part research seminar, one part exhibition design lab, in order to aid in the 1) framing, 2) research, and 3) planning, and 4) design and creation of an exhibition and publication materials, using Harlem-related material, sites, and archives as the subject matter, while making connections to other geographies and critical questions of preservation, culture, and design.","103":"Lighting forms the basis for how all human beings see and experience the physical environment. This course includes an overview of the various topics that influence contemporary architectural lighting design including historical context, properties of light, optics, daylight, vision\/perception, color the physiological effects of light and sustainability. This class introduces the technical and practical aspects of the lighting design and system integration process, the physics of light, lamp and luminaire technology, basic calculations, use of technical data and rudimentary applications.","104":"Waterproofing or Let the Water In. Modern urban water systems are unobtrusive by design. The pipes bringing water to our homes and draining our streets are hidden underground. Treatment plants are tucked away on the water?s edge or in an obscure part of the city that almost nobody visits. Even the huge reservoirs that hold our drinking water are locked behind fences in protected watersheds. It is clear that we need to let the water in, but, at the same time, we are obsessed with the opposite. Or, to put it more simply, we constantly build barriers to protect against the risk of water and flooding. The vocabulary of waterproofing is pretty clear: close, enclose, isolate, plug, secure and shut, we are at war with water and we often loose battles. Buildings leak, architects are sued. Hurricanes flood the city, power grids go down. Sea level rises, the real estate markets shudder. Climate change has announced an era of unpredictability that impacts directly on the existing built environment and future design interventions. It is clear that we need strategies and concepts that stabilize our environments and their relations to water?a scientific approach to spatial design and architectural detailing. In this class, our task is to read, re-use, transform, and manipulate what is already there to create a new experience of bodily movement, speed, and rhythm as we immerse ourselves in a natural element within the bounds of the city. We will take on the challenge of looking for past and future urban ecologies that envision alternative urban structures and hydraulic systems operating from the premise that human and non-human ecological systems are irrevocably intertwined. We will look back to historical examples from ancient Roman times to the New York Era of Public Baths and consider contemporary examples to understand their public role and their operative systems. We will disassemble the distinct spatial components of structures in many parts of the world, to investigated and","105":"Corporeal Accommodations: Furniture. This course is a study through design and making, on the question \"what is furniture?\" ? that is to determine what it can be. It will further this question by posing more such as: What is use beyond utilitarianism? When and how should be one comfortable? What can be the effects of sensory input from tactile constructs on human body and psyche? What is the relationship between space and furniture? Who determines furniture and how? Who makes furniture? What is the history of furniture in vernacular, crafts and in relation to mass production? Through lectures, readings, case studies and small exercises participants are to acquire a critical view towards such questions. On this foundation, the material objective of this course is to produce a furniture piece as a culmination of this critical viewpoint. With regards the making process, along with material experimentations, techniques and tools needed for each project (e.g. woodworking) will be explored through prototyping. In parallel to the development of core concepts and merits and therefore the design of this construct, short skill-based exercises are given to the participants in the first weeks of the semester. In the remainder of the semester the two paths of theory\/design and tactile making methods converge to produce the furniture piece. Starting with scaled models and material tests the design and construction choices are to evolve into the making and refinement of the final furniture piece, to be documented and presented.","106":"Building Information Modeling (BIM) is transforming architectural design and construction practice by combining 3D geometry with building component data. Representing the building spaces, systems, materials and costs in one integrated database allows more seamless collaboration throughout the building life-cycle. Enabling clients, designers, engineers and builders to see how building systems come together improves efficiency, reduces errors and allows control of greater complexity.","107":"This course aims to present contemporary methods of digital representation for architects. There will be an intensive exploration of the materiality, experiences, methodologies and techniques occurring in digital representation in contemporary practice. The pedagogy will focus on creating high quality rendering images and animations from 3D modeling (by your own). In addition to learning the subject through readings, lectures, and videos, students will gain hands-on rendering experience. Several programming assignments build on each other as the students learn to render images of curved and polygonal 3D models with local and global illumination, reflections, refractions, shadows, and more. Each student will then design and carry out few personal projects (please see project section for more detail), focusing on some interesting aspect of computer image generation. Ideally, students in this course should have some exposure to 3D computer modeling using AutoCAD, Rhino, or Revit. This course is designed so that a student with a moderate modeling skill and no 3D rendering experience can still succeed. REQUIRED ACCESS TO SOFTWARE & HARDWARE: You will need access to a Windows PC with a current version of 3DS Max\/VRay\/Photoshop to complete the course requirements. You must have, before taking this course, a good understanding of how to use Microsoft Windows computers and basic Windows software such as internet browsers, email clients, and image viewers.

You will also need a capable computer to do our class activities.","108":"This course provides students with a critical understanding of practicing responsible architecture and engineering from a materials and products perspective. It will cover the full range of complex issues involved in material selection and specification: critical health and environmental issues and life-cycle analysis. Using current evaluation tools (Athena, Pharos Lens, CSI Green Spec, and others) students will research materials and products according to cost, availability, and environmental performance criteria to include embodied energy, life-cycle LEED criteria such as salvaged, renewable, and environmentally benign materials or products with recycled-content. \"Smart materials\" will also be considered. The seminar will produce a first draft of green specifications for a generic project.","109":"The aim of the course is to introduce state-of-the-art methodologies and tools for integrated design and optimization of energy efficient buildings with a good indoor environment. Focus is on the first part of the design process. The methodology for integrated design is based on listing of the functional requirements of buildings, preparation of space of solutions, generating of design proposals, and optimization analyses and decision processes. The participants will, on individual basis, work on development of the integrated design processes in relation to their own research projects.","110":"Teaching Assistant in Architecture","111":"Teaching Assistant in Architecture","112":"Teaching Assistant in Architecture","113":"Teaching Assistant in Architecture","114":"Teaching Assistant in Architecture","115":"Concepts underlying content, formal structure and historical development of the visual arts;

The first, that it was a time of significant insulation between cultures which (if they interacted at all) were mainly throwing as many swords at each other as possible or were otherwise comprised of a bunch of white people waiting around for the Enlightenment. The second, that the period has had a negligible impact on contemporary cultures and is something that should be swept under the nearest rug available. Our course will interrogate these views of the Middle Ages through the literature it produced, and the literature, film, and music which is produced about it. We will attempt to construct a more nuanced view of the medieval period. One which, while including a fair share of sword throwing, also acknowledges cross cultural interactions which were decidedly less sharp. We will also examine how the medieval informs the modern in negative and positive ways so that we can recognize why some people are still throwing swords, and why so many books have something to do with a dragon.","1032":"The 19th and 20th centuries were marked by widespread social and political unrest. Yet during this period, a revolution of the mind also took place. Marx envisions the end of class struggle through the awakening of consciousness, and Freud proposes that understanding unconscious thought can unlock inner desires. Both theorists share a radical awareness of oppression and a drive to expose hidden powers?our own and those which challenge us. In this course, we will try to link the revolutions of modernity (sociopolitical, technological, and intellectual) with the transformations happening simultaneously within the world of poetry (formal, linguistic, and conceptual): the democratization of poetic language; the break from traditional literary conventions; the mixing of genres and blending of different speech types. We will consider how poetic reflection might be turned into practical action, and if there?s a relationship between emerging genres of ?free verse? and the prose poem and the growth of the industrial working class. We will also explore the ways art succeeds or fails in shaping the tenets of revolutionary thinking.","1033":"This course invites students to engage the genre of life-writing through various mediums including novels, poetry, lyrics, oral history, and interviews.

In other words, students will (1) produce digital content that is (2) shared through a website and (3) promoted through a social network. These pragmatic activities provide the framework for understanding rhetorical theory as it relates to digital environments, and how rhetorical theory informs the design, circulation, and attention economics of digital production.","1037":"Making a Monster: Race and Monstrosity in American Film and Literature","1038":"The riches of contemporary immigration literature permit us to address difficult questions of the politics and poetics of language, culture, and self.

Petesch; plays by Martyna Majok and David Henry Hwang; and a selection of poems by Rodolfo Anaya, Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Czeslaw Milosz, and Simon J. Ortiz.","1039":"The meteoric rise of the medical profession, starting in the late 19th century, with its strictly ?materialist? approach to health--and its unprecedented separation from ?spirituality? and what is now called ?psychology?--has greatly transformed the very conception of the human being. From that period until now, literature, which is of course centrally concerned with characters and human experience, has both reflected and contested this modern medicalization. We will consider the literary representations of illness and doctors--and their relation to the medical versions of these--in American works, as well as a couple of European works that had great impact in the US, from the 1890s to the present","1040":"The class will explore issues of race, sexuality, and how these topics intersect as a reflection of America?s notion of the ?pursuit of happiness.?

We will explore how in his works seemingly private or narrow narrative tropes connect with larger universal themes.

This book established Merleau-Ponty as the leading French phenomenologist of his generation. The unifying theme of the Phenomenology is perception, and the experience of the body as the perceptual organ. It argues that the complex way we exist in our bodies connects us to the world and makes us conscious of the world. It explores existential dimensions including sexuality, language, space, nature, intersubjectivity, time, and freedom. It combines ideas from traditional phenomenology?especially from its founder, Edmund Husserl?with developments in cognitive neuroscience, social science, history, literature, art, and politics. Because of these diverse and fascinating themes, it inspires interdisciplinary work across a wide range of disciplines.","1750":"It is difficult to name two arenas of human thought that have shaped civilization as powerfully as have religion and science. Yet they appear to stand in great tension -- if not outright opposition -- with one another: while religion typically involves faith in a divine creator and belief in supernatural phenomena, science purportedly deals in reason alone, describing objective facts about natural phenomena. But are science and belief in God really at odds? Do they say conflicting things about causation, free will, consciousness, morality, the origin of life and the cosmos? What roles do belief, reason, evidence, truth and objectivity play in religious versus scientific worldviews? This class explores such questions through the lens of history (principally in the West, and with respect to monotheistic traditions) and through critical examination of the nature, practices and aims of contemporary scientific and religious thought.","1751":"A critical survey of philosophical theories of scientific explanation and development.

While decolonization is generally considered in reference to geo-political systemic structures, its applicability to mental health service delivery is of critical import to psychology. Colonization perpetuates the status quo, maintaining power dominance of a White, Patriarchal, Racist, Homophobic hierarchy. Western mental health and social service methodologies serve to perpetuate colonization, justifying the dominance of a White, Patriarchal systemic structure. This course will serve to examine the systemic implication of a mental health service delivery that ?blames the victim?, and perpetuates an oppressive systemic culture that deleteriously impacts the lives of women, immigrants, folk of color, LGBTQ folk, etc. Western mental health focuses on pathology, branding traumatized and oppressed folk as ?ill?, mentally unbalanced, paranoid, ?out of control?, etc. Decolonizing mental health service delivery enables the psychology student to focus on a Strength Based approach, that emphasizes ?positives?, and, employs a non-directive, empowering therapeutic stance. The psychologist\/therapist is neither god, nor more powerful all-knowing. Rather, a decolonizing mental health approach emphasizes the partnership of therapist and patient. The therapist listens, shares, participates in full partnership with his\/her patient. Illuminating this course will be the writings and clinical practice of Frantz Fanon, an Afro-French psychiatrist and 1960?s spokesperson of the successful Algerian Revolution against French colonial oppression. Finally, the empowerment process inherent in therapeutic healing, is embedded within an understanding of context and trauma. Oppressed folk reflect rage, resistance, as well as internalization of said oppression, resulting in self-destructive behavior. Enabling such folk to see, feel, and comprehend their oppression is a critical first step in healing.","1964":"This course investigates the complex social and cultural processes that shape our experiences and meanings of mental health.

Students will use the course methodologies and theories to trouble normative concepts of health and wellness in order to arrive at alternative definitions of health and healing. The course is interdisciplinary in scope and will draw on frameworks of mental health from diverse fields including medical sociology, affect theory, critical race theory, feminist and queer theory, and disability studies to explore the entanglements between our psychic lives and social words.","1965":"PSYCHOLOGY OF FASHION","1966":"Students who want permissions for this course can request them here: https:\/\/form.jotform.com\/222995305110955 The course is offered under the auspices of the Department of Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. https:\/\/www.ccny.cuny.edu\/cwe","1967":"A study of the psychological bases and dynamics of criminal behavior.
